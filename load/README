This directory contains the code to load and set up the kernel AFTER the
bootloader gives us control.

The code here, except for kernel_init.c, is linked at the kernel's physical
address.  loader.s is called by the bootloader.  It then sets up the GDT,
various other low level things, sets up paging and calls kinit.

kinit, which is linked in the kernel's virtual address space, cleans up,
finishes the switch from physical to virtual addresses, unmaps the physical
memory we set up for bootstrapping, and calls kmain().  From kmain() onwards,
everything runs in virtual memory.
